A super fast, integrated and simple diagnostic tool for MRSA screening.

## Description
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is a highly contagious and asymptomatic bacterial
infection. It has the potential to transmit rapidly between hospital patients since it spreads by open
wounds, burns, feeding tubes, or by being in contact with shared surfaces (It forms biofilms on surfaces
that infected individuals touch). Consequently, hospital administrators and staff would like to identify
and isolate infected individuals as rapidly and as efficiently as possible before these individuals can
transmit MRSA to other patients. The current diagnostic technology is the bacteria culture and
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which unfortunately take &gt;24 hours and ~8 hours respectively to
retrieve a result. We believe that diagnoses can be done even more rapidly with microfluidic devices,
which offer the essential advantage of analyzing smaller volumes at faster rates. This in turn leads to a
rapid diagnosis (within 10 minutes).

## Projected Outcomes
Our product is a microfluidic device which screens admitted hospital patients for MRSA. We call it
MinutesToMRSA. Imagine a world where a nurse can perform an automated diagnostic test at the point of
care (at the patientâ€™s bedside) and retrieve results within minutes. Getting this product from ideation to
widespread use in hospitals is an example of High-Throughput Screening and Diagnostics Engineering:
we identified a clinical need, we proposed a viable solution which will improve healthcare outcomes,
and we embark on this project to design the product. We expect the following outcomes when our
product is available:
Hospital staff will have an easier time micromanaging both patients and isolated rooms and they will be
able to make more informed decisions about using the antibiotic vancomycin.
Hospital administrators will spend less money on vancomycin and on controlling outbreaks.
Patients will appreciate that their practitioners can make timely and informed decisions on how to
proceed with their treatment.
